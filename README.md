RECCurection
============

Greetings, crazy famicom fans!

I'm going to make *Summer Carnival '92 Recca* famicom cartridge reproduction. Why? Because original cartridge is worth about $200-300 USD, it is kinda expensive/overpriced for me. Awesome good game, flawless soundtrack. So I decided to create my own eprom-burner on the top of atmega16 MCU from scratch.

Dependencies
------------
* suitable cartridge board with DIP maskroms and MMC3 mapper - [HVC-TLROM](http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?unif=HVC-TLROM)
* 2 blank 1MBit EPROMs (27C010 is okay)
* eprom-burner
* ability to remove old maskroms and solder newly-burned eproms
* GNU toolchain for AVR

Project Goals
-------------
* take advantage of rs232 protocol
* utilize my unused MCU hardware
* ...
* build mature and solid repro with no crappy glob-top epoxy ICs
* have sex and fun


Cheers, アレクス。
